# Task 2
There are three training sets where each consists of eight physical properties, and the capacity factor as target variable.
The three training sets are created from a PDE solver with different level of accuracy.
Therefore we have a set with high accuracy but with only a few sample, a set with intermediate accuracy and intermediate number of samples
and a set with low accuracy but with many samples.
