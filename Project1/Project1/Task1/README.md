## Problems overcome
Build the whole neural network pipeline from scratch:
- read in training and testing data, preprocess it and transform it to the desired network input type
- create predictions using the testing data and write out the result in the correct format
- calculate loss function correctly such that varying batch size is taken into account
- create an adaptable neural network (mainly adapted from provided course code template)
- add progress bar to get a better overview of training process
- save and load model
- IO to keep track of the parameters and losses of each model
