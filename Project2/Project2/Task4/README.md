# Task 4

Given is a training set that consists of time, velocity and temperature. Additionally, there is 
a measured set that consists of time and temperature. The goal is to find the optimal velocity that created the measured data.


## Problems overcome
- Define cost function for the optimization of the velocity => L2-norm
- Find a good model to predict the temperature from time and velocity
- Find a good optimizer to find the optimal velocity u_*

## Best Model
