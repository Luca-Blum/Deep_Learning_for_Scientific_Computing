# Deep learning for scientific computing projects

## Purpose
This repository is used for the development of the projects for the deep learning for scientific computing course 
of Professor S. Mishra lectured at ETH Zurich during the spring semester 2021.

## Usage
**Load conda virtual environment:**  
conda env create -f environment.yml  
conda activate pytorch  

**Run code:** (in corresponding directories (e.g. /Task1):  
python3 main.py

**Deactivate conda virtual environment:**   
conda deactivate
  
**Remove conda virtual environment:**  
conda remove --name pytorch --all
